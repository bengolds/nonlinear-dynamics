# Nonlinear Dynamics

This is a set of interactive visualizations of topics in nonlinear dynamics. They are based off of the exercises in [Santa Fe Institute's Nonlinear Dynamics MOOC](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/60-nonlinear-dynamics-mathematical-and-computational-approaches-fall-2016) and [Stephen Strogatz's Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering)
